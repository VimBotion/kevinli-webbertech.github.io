# PyTorch - Neural Networks to Functional Blocks

Training a deep learning algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Building a data pipeline
2. Building a network architecture
3. Evaluating the architecture using a loss function
4. Optimizing the network architecture weights using an optimization algorithm

Training a specific deep learning algorithm requires converting a neural network into functional blocks as shown below:

With respect to the above diagram, any deep learning algorithm involves:

- **Getting the input data**
- **Building the respective architecture**: This includes a series of layers embedded in the network.

In the diagram, the accuracy is evaluated using a loss function with respect to the optimization of the weights of the neural network.
