PyTorch - Neural Networks to Functional Blocks


Training a deep learning algorithm involves the following steps âˆ’

Building a data pipeline
Building a network architecture
Evaluating the architecture using a loss function
Optimizing the network architecture weights using an optimization algorithm

Training a specific deep learning algorithm is the exact requirement of converting a neural network to functional blocks as shown below





With respect to the above diagram, any deep learning algorithm involves getting the input data, building the respective architecture which includes a bunch of layers embedded in them.

If you observe the above diagram, the accuracy is evaluated using a loss function with respect to optimization of the weights of neural network.
