Features of Recursive Neural Network
A recursive neural network is created in such a way that it includes applying same set of weights with different graph like structures.

The nodes are traversed in topological order.

This type of network is trained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation.

Natural language processing includes a special case of recursive neural networks.

This recursive neural tensor network includes various composition functional nodes in the tree.

The example of recursive neural network is demonstrated below âˆ’
