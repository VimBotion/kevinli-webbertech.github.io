# Classic Machine Learning

## What Is Classical Machine Learning?

Classical ML uses models, or algorithms, to analyze massive data sets, identify patterns, and make predictions without human intervention. Organizations use ML-identified patterns and trends to make smarter, faster decisions that can improve business efficiency, improve security, and create new data-driven products and services tailored to customer behaviors. Common ML models include `linear regression`, `logistic regression`, `support vector machines`, `nearest neighbor similarity search`, and `decision trees`.

Classical ML models are often computationally lighter than deep learning neural networks. They rely heavily on the quality of the data they learn from and are considered explainable AI. `Explainable AI` gives organizations, decision-makers, and data scientists traceable insight into how an algorithm arrived at a specific result. With transparency into how the algorithm works, users can identify potential biases and discover how variables contribute to an outcome. Explainable AI is often required for regulated industries such as `financial services` and `government`.

## Classical Machine Learning Use Cases

Classical ML models are used for a variety of real-world applications across the **financial services**, **health and life sciences**, **retail**, **research**, and **manufacturing industries**. For example, financial institutions can build, train, and implement ML models to **identify and predict fraudulent credit card transactions** faster and more accurately, reducing the amount of money lost annually to fraud and better protecting sensitive customer information. Other popular ML use cases include **customized marketing**, **visual quality control in manufacturing**, **personalized medicine**, and **retail demand forecasting**.

## Classic Machine Learning Hardware [CPU without GPU]

With a broad hardware portfolio of processors and integrated accelerators, Intel makes it easier for you find a cost-effective solution or maximize the value of your existing CPUs to meet your project and budget needs—without requiring the purchase of an external GPU.

Getting more from your CPU also helps you get more from common tools for classical ML, including scikit-learn, which doesn’t support the use of GPUs or GPU acceleration.

Let’s look at some of the cost-effective Intel® solutions you can take advantage of.

* Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors: Designed to handle the most demanding AI workloads, these CPUs offer a larger memory capacity for the large data sets required for classical machine learning. With integrated Intel® Accelerator Engines purpose-built to maximize performance and efficiency for the most demanding, compute-intensive workloads, you can extract more value from your investment without the need for additional specialized hardware purchases.

* Intel® Data Science Workstations: One machine that resides locally and combines large memory span, multiple expansion slots for more device connectivity. This system also includes a CPU designed to handle the demands of data science tasks and can be optimized, when needed, to avoid the purchase of an external GPU.Intel®-based data science workstations are offered in three platform options—mobile, mainstream, and expert. They are Intel® Core™ Processors, Intel® Xeon® W processors, or Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and come in a variety of configurations and price ranges to align your performance needs with your budget. Intel® Data Science Workstations ship from our partners and manufacturers Dell, Z by HP, and Lenovo.
