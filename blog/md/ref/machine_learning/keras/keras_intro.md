# INTRODUCTION TO KERAS

## History

The history of the Keras framework is marked by its evolution from a simple, user-friendly API for neural networks to becoming an integral part of the TensorFlow ecosystem. Here is an overview of its development:

### Early Development (2015)

- **Creator**: Keras was developed by Fran√ßois Chollet, an engineer at Google.

- **Initial Release**: Keras was first introduced in March 2015 as an open-source library.

- **Goal**: The main aim was to provide a simple, modular, and extensible framework for building neural networks that could run on top of Theano or TensorFlow.

### Initial Popularity

- **User-Friendly**: Keras gained popularity quickly due to its high-level interface, which made it easier for developers and researchers to build and experiment with complex neural networks.

- **Modularity**: The framework's modular nature allowed users to easily customize and extend components, making it highly flexible for various deep learning tasks.

### Integration with TensorFlow (2017)

- **TensorFlow Adoption**: In 2017, with the release of TensorFlow 1.0, Google announced that Keras would be the high-level API for TensorFlow, effectively making it the default high-level interface for building neural networks within the TensorFlow ecosystem.

- **Keras 2.0**: This version was released to provide better integration with TensorFlow and to unify the APIs across different backends.

### Keras as Part of TensorFlow (2019)

- **TensorFlow 2.0**: With the release of TensorFlow 2.0 in September 2019, Keras was integrated as `tf.keras` within TensorFlow. This integration streamlined the user experience, making it easier to use Keras with TensorFlow without needing separate installations.

- **Improved Functionality**: The integration brought in improved performance, better debugging tools, and a more cohesive development environment.

### Current Status

- **Standalone Keras**: While Keras is now part of TensorFlow, the standalone version of Keras (`keras-team/keras`) continues to be maintained as a separate project, ensuring backward compatibility and support for other backends like Theano and PlaidML.

- **Wide Adoption**: Keras remains one of the most popular deep learning frameworks due to its simplicity and ease of use. It is widely used in academia, research, and industry for various machine learning and deep learning tasks.

### Key Features and Advantages

- **User-Friendly API**: Keras is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it accessible for beginners while also being powerful for experts.

- **Modularity and Extensibility**: Users can easily combine different modules to create complex models, and they can extend the framework with custom components.

- **Backend Flexibility**: Initially designed to run on top of multiple backends (Theano, TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and PlaidML), Keras now predominantly leverages TensorFlow.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: A large community of users and developers contribute to the Keras ecosystem, providing extensive resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries.

Keras has played a significant role in democratizing deep learning by lowering the barrier to entry and enabling more people to experiment with and apply deep learning techniques. Organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei and Uber are currently using Keras.
