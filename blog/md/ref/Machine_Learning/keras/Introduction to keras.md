# **INTRODUCTION TO KERAS**

**Its an open source deep learning framework for Python developed by an artificial intelligence researcher at Google named Fran√ßois Chollet. Organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei, and Uber are currently using Keras.**

## **What is Deep Learning?**

- **It's a subfield of machine learning.** Deep learning is becoming more popular in data science fields like robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), audio & video recognition, and image recognition.
- **Deep learning is supported by various libraries** such as Theano, TensorFlow, Caffe, MxNet, etc. Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for creating deep learning models.

## **Overview of Keras**

Keras is based on a minimal structure that provides a clean and easy way to create deep learning models based on TensorFlow or Theano. Keras is designed to quickly define deep learning models. Keras is an optimal choice for deep learning applications.

## **Features and Advantages**
