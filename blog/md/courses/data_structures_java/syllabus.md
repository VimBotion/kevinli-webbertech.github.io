## Goal

After a 15-week study of Java data structure, we would master basic algorithm programming, including bastic data stuctures array, linklist, stack, queue, tree, graph, also with these data structures, we would be learning some most popular algorithms in searching, sorting, tree and graph theory. And optionally we will look at a lot of new and advanced data structures which would not likely be covered in most coding interviews but we would lightly touch up those.

We will provide you a comprehensive introduction of coding interview, how to should prepare for it, and the various platforms you can brush up your coding skills. I will also give you tips on algorithm design in general, thinking process, factors that might impact your coding behaviors and performance such as keyboard, mouse, cheatsheet, and digitalize and quick index of your code base...etc.

## Homework

Per week or biweekly. Depending on the homework size.

**Submission requirement**

* Homework Submission: File upload
* Homework should include at least one word or pdf document. Any code should be put into a zip file, please do not use WinRAR or tar.gz format.
* Please write your full name in the homework document.
* For assignment with coding, please take screenshot to prove that it is working.

## No late submission

* Professor will not send email to urge you for homework.
* It is your responsibility to submit them on time.
* Late submission are subject to 10 pts loss.
