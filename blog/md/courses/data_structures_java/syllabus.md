## Goal

After 15-week study of Java data structure, we would master basic algorithm programming, 
including array, stack, queue, tree, graph, also with these data structures, we would be learning some most popular algorithms in searching, sorting, tree and graph theory.

## Homework

Per week or biweekly. Depending on the homework size.

**Submission requirement**

* Homework Submission: File upload
* Homework should include at least one word or pdf document. Any code should be put into a zip file, please do not use WinRAR or tar.gz format.
* Please write your full name in the homework document.
* For assignment with coding, please take screenshot to prove that it is working.

## No late submission

* Professor will not send email to urge you for homework.
* It is your responsibility to submit them on time.

## Course Schedule

This course provides an opportunity for students to learn the foundations of computer data structure programming with required algorithms.
