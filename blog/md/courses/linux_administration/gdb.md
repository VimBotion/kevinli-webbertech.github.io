# GDB

## Overview

* Create a binary with debugging info using `gcc`
* Debug binary using `gdb`
* `nm` util's usage
* `ldd` 's usage

## **Using `gcc` for Debugging in Linux**

When developing in C, debugging is crucial for identifying and fixing errors. The GNU Debugger (`gdb`) is commonly used alongside `gcc` to debug programs.

---

### **1. Compile with Debugging Information**
To enable debugging, compile with the `-g` flag:
```bash
gcc -g program.c -o program
```
- `-g` → Includes debugging symbols.

---

### **2. Run the Program in `gdb`**
Start debugging:
```bash
gdb ./program
```

---

### **3. Setting Breakpoints**
Inside `gdb`, you can set breakpoints:
```gdb
break main
```
or on a specific line:
```gdb
break 10
```

---

### **4. Running the Program**
Start execution:
```gdb
run
```

---

### **5. Stepping Through Code**
- Step into a function:
  ```gdb
  step
  ```
- Step over (execute current line and move to the next):
  ```gdb
  next
  ```

---

### **6. Printing Variables**
- Print a variable’s value:
  ```gdb
  print x
  ```
- Print all local variables:
  ```gdb
  info locals
  ```

---

### **7. Backtrace (Check Call Stack)**
If the program crashes, use:
```gdb
backtrace
```
to see the function call history.

---

### **8. Continue Execution**
Resume execution after a breakpoint:
```gdb
continue
```

---

### **9. Quit `gdb`**
Exit debugging:
```gdb
quit
```

## **`nm`

### **`nm` (List Symbols in a Binary or Library)**

The `nm` command displays the symbol table of an object file, executable, or library.

#### **Usage Examples**

- List symbols in an object file:
  ```bash
  nm math_operations.o
  ```

* For a static library:

`nm libmylib.a`


* List symbols in a shared library:
  ```bash
  nm -D libmath.so
  ```

another example,

`nm -D /usr/lib/libc.so.6`

* Filter only defined functions:
 
  ```bash
  nm -g --defined-only program
  ```

### Symbol Types (TYPE column)
The key to understanding nm output is the symbol type, which is a single character:

- T (Text section): Function (global) defined in the file.
- t (Text section, local): Local function (static).
- U (Undefined): The symbol is referenced but not defined (e.g., an external function like printf).
- D/d (Data section): Global/local initialized data (global/static variables).
- B/b (BSS section): Uninitialized global/static variables.
- R/r (Read-only data section): Read-only data (constants).
- A (Absolute): A symbol with a fixed memory address.
- C (Common): Uninitialized global variable (allocated at runtime).
- V/v (Weak symbol): Can be overridden by another definition.

### Useful nm Options

-g: Show only global symbols.
-C: Demangle C++ symbols.
-A: Show file name before each symbol (useful for multiple files).
-l: Show source file and line number (if available).
--defined-only: Show only symbols defined in the file.

## **`ldd` (List Shared Library Dependencies)**

The `ldd` command shows the shared libraries required by a binary.

### **Usage Examples**

- Check dependencies of an executable:
  ```bash
  ldd /bin/ls
  ```
- Check dependencies of a compiled program:
  ```bash
  ldd ./program
  ```
- Check dependencies of a shared library:
  ```bash
  ldd libmath.so
  ```
