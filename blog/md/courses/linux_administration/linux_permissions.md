# Linux Permission

In Linux, permissions control the access to files and directories for different users. Each file or directory has three types of permissions and three categories of users.

### 1. **Types of Permissions:**
   - **Read (r):** Allows reading the contents of a file or listing the contents of a directory.
   - **Write (w):** Allows modifying a file or adding/removing files in a directory.
   - **Execute (x):** Allows running a file as a program or script. For directories, it grants permission to enter or access the directory.

### 2. **User Categories:**
   - **Owner (u):** The user who owns the file.
   - **Group (g):** Users who belong to the file’s group.
   - **Others (o):** All other users on the system who are not the owner or in the group.

### 3. **Permission Representation:**
   Permissions are displayed using a 10-character string. For example:
   ```
   -rwxr-xr--
   ```
   - The first character (`-`) indicates the type of file (a `-` means it's a regular file, a `d` means it's a directory).
   - The next three characters represent the owner's permissions (`rwx` means read, write, and execute).
   - The next three characters represent the group's permissions.
   - The final three characters represent the permissions for others.

### 4. **Changing Permissions with `chmod`:**
   - **Symbolic mode:** Use characters to represent permissions.
     - Example: `chmod u+x file.txt` adds execute permission for the owner.
     - Example: `chmod go-w file.txt` removes write permission from the group and others.

   - **Numeric mode:** Permissions are represented by a three-digit number.
     - `r=4`, `w=2`, `x=1`.
     - Example: `chmod 755 file.txt` gives:
       - Owner (7 = read + write + execute),
       - Group (5 = read + execute),
       - Others (5 = read + execute).

### 5. **Changing Ownership with `chown`:**
   You can change the owner or group of a file or directory with the `chown` command.
   - Example: `chown user:group file.txt` changes the owner to `user` and the group to `group`.

### 6. **Viewing Permissions with `ls -l`:**
   To see the permissions of a file or directory, use the `ls -l` command:
   ```
   ls -l file.txt
   ```
   This will output something like:
   ```
   -rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Jan 1 12:00 file.txt
   ```

### 7. **Special Permissions:**
   - **Setuid (s):** When set on a file, it allows the file to be run with the permissions of the file owner.
   - **Setgid (g):** When set on a file, it allows the file to be run with the permissions of the file's group.
   - **Sticky bit (t):** When set on a directory, it ensures that only the file's owner can delete or rename files in that directory (commonly used for `/tmp`).

## **Granting root privilege to normal user**

Generally in Linux, a system administrator does everything possible as a normal user. It's a good practice to use superuser privileges only when absolutely necessary. But one time when it's appropriate is during the Red Hat exams. Good administrators will return to being normal users when they're done with their tasks. Mistakes as the root user can disable your Linux system. There are two basic ways to make this work:

### **su**

The superuser command, su, prompts you for the root password before logging you in with root privileges.

su command without any arguments will ask for root password. By giving root password you will get root privilege. To execute any command you should know the exact path of command otherwise you get command not found error. Because you will not get root’s command path. To get root’s environments and command paths and home directory use – hyphen sign with su commands

**Limiting Access to su**

First, you will need to add the users who you want to allow access to the su command. Make them a part of the wheel group. By default, this line in /etc/group looks like:

 `wheel:x:10:root`

You can add the users of your choice to the end of this line directly, with the usermod -G wheel [username] command, or with the Red Hat User Manager.

 `#usermod –G wheel vinita`

Next, you will need to make your Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) look for this group. You can do so by activating the following command in your /etc/pam.d/su file:

 `# auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid `

### **sudo**

The sudo command allows users listed in /etc/sudoers to run administrative commands. You can configure /etc/sudoers to set limits on the root privileges granted to a specific user.

The sudo command allows users listed in /etc/sudoers to run administrative commands. You can configure /etc/sudoers to set limits on the root privileges granted to a specific user.

To use sudo commands you don't need to give root password. A user with appropriate right from /etc/sudoers can execute root privilege command form his own passwords.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides some features that make working as root somewhat safer. For example, logins using the ftp and telnet commands to remote computers are disabled by default.

**Limiting Access to sudo**

You can limit access to the sudo command. Regular users who are authorized in /etc/sudoers can access administrative commands with their own password. You don't need to give out the administrative password to everyone who thinks they know as much as you do about Linux. To access /etc/sudoers in the vi editor, run the visudo command.

`linux vi /etc/sudoers`

From the following directive, the root user is allowed full access to administrative commands:

For example, if you want to allow user vinita full administrative access, add the following directive to `/etc/sudoers`:

`root ALL=(ALL) ALL vinita ALL=(ALL) ALL`

In this case, all vinita needs to do to run an administrative command such as starting the network service from her regular account is to run the following command, entering her own user password (note the regular user prompt, $):

`$ sudo /sbin/service network restart Password:`

You can even allow special users administrative access without a password. As suggested by the comments, the following directive in /etc/sudoers would allow all users in the wheel group to run administrative commands without a password:

`%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`

But you don't have to allow full administrative access. For example, if you want to allow those in the %users group to shut down the local system, you can activate the following directive:

`%users localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now`
