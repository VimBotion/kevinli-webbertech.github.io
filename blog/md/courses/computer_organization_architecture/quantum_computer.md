# Quantum Computer

## What is Quantum computing

* Quantum vs Classic Computer

![Quantum_Computer](../../../images/computer_architecture/Quantum_Computer.png)

Both uses chips and logic gates,

Classic computer relies on 0,1 for state, either 0 or 1. While quantum can have both used at the same time.

but we don't know which is up and which is down, but if we measure to know one is up , and the other is down,
