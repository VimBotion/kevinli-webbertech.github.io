# Git

## Intro to Git


## Github or bitbucket

Both are code repositories and both use git commands.

## Installation

Please go to the following website to make sure you find an installer for your operating system.

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once the installation is done, please make sure that you have `git bash` in windows and that will be a little easier to practice the git commands.

## Git commands

Git commands can be handy and there are also a lot of git GUI such as in `Visual tudio Code`, `Eclipse` or `IntelliJ` which could make it even easier.

As a beginner, I think learning some git commands are extremely helpful for you to understand how it works and you can troubleshoot some difficult issues when it comes up.
