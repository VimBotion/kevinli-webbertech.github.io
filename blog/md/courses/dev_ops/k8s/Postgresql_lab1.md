### What is TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB is an extension for PostgreSQL that enables time-series workloads, increasing ingest, query, storage and analytics performance.

Best practice is to run TimescaleDB in a Timescale Service, but if you want to self-host you can run TimescaleDB yourself.

### Cloud version - Commercial

## Install TimescaleDB

### Container types

The two container types store PostgreSQL data dir in different places, make sure you select the correct one to mount:

|Container|PGDATA location |
|---|---|
|timescaledb-ha|/home/postgres/pgdata/data|
|timescaledb|/var/lib/postgresql/data|

### Docker running image

- Run the TimescaleDB Docker image

```shell
docker pull timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17
```

- Run the container

```shell
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17
```

On UNIX based systems, Docker modifies Linux IP tables to bind the container. If your system uses Linux Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), Docker may override your UFW port binding settings. To prevent this, add DOCKER_OPTS="--iptables=false" to /etc/default/docker.

- Connect to a database on your PostgreSQL instance

```commandline
psql -d "postgres://postgres:password@localhost/postgres"
```

- Check that TimescaleDB is installed

```commandline
\dx
```

Then we will see,

```commandline
List of installed extensions
Name         | Version |   Schema   |                                      Description
---------------------+---------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
plpgsql             | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
timescaledb         | 2.17.2  | public     | Enables scalable inserts and complex queries for time-series data (Community Edition)
timescaledb_toolkit | 1.19.0  | public     | Library of analytical hyperfunctions, time-series pipelining, and other SQL utilities
(3 rows)
```

If you want to access the container from the host but avoid exposing it to the outside world, you can bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of the public interface, using this command:

```shell
docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg17
```

If you don't want to install psql and other PostgreSQL client tools locally, or if you are using a Microsoft Windows host system, you can connect using the version of psql that is bundled within the container with this command:

```shell
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres
```

## Other docker usage

Existing containers can be stopped using `docker stop` and started again with `docker start` while retaining their volumes and data.

When you create a new container using the docker run command, by default you also create a new data volume. When you remove a Docker container with `docker rm` the data volume persists on disk until you explicitly delete it.

You can use the `docker volume ls` command to list existing docker volumes. If you want to store the data from your Docker container in a host directory, or you want to run the Docker image on top of an existing data directory, you can specify the directory to mount a data volume using the -v flag.

### Logs in docker container

If you have TimescaleDB installed in a Docker container, you can view your logs using Docker, instead of looking in /var/lib/logs or /var/logs.

## Amazon AWS EC2

It is desirable to run a docker image on the EC2 instance, and we need to have a docker on it too.

### Install Docker (if not already installed)

`sudo yum install -y docker`

### Start a sample Docker image (e.g., a simple web server)

`docker run -d -p 80:8080 <image_name>:<tag>`
