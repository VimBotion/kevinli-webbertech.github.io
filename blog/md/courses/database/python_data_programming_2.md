# Python Data Programming - CSV and TSV file

## Get to know Data file format

* **CSV file**, is the most commonly seen data file format. It is comma seperated file. It is an ASCII file. While on the other hand,
 Excel file is a binary file although Excel sheet can be exported to CSV format.

* **TSV**, tab or whitespace separated file.

> Hint: CSV and TSV are type of similar files, so we only introduce how to read/write csv file in the following sections.

## Multiple ways to read/write CSV file

**Using csv read and writer**

The following example is to read from CSV,

```python
import csv
with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
  spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
  spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
  spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
```
The following example is to write to a CSV,

```python
import csv
with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
```

Another read example,

```python
import csv
with open('some.csv', newline='') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

If your csv file is delimited by ":", you can use the following example,

```python
import csv
with open('passwd', newline='') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=':', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

**Using DictReader to read/write**

The following example is to read from CSV,

```python
import csv
with open('names.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
  reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)

for row in reader:
  print(row['first_name'], row['last_name'])
```

The following example is to write to a CSV,

```python
import csv

with open('students.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile, dialect='unix')
```

**Using Pandas to read/write**

The following example is to read a csv file,

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.to_string()) 
```

## Programming Lab

* Download the data.csv file from here [data.csv]("data.csv").

* Open PyCharm Community Version,
