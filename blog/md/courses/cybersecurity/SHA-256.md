# **SHA-256** Algorithm

---

### 🔐 What is SHA-256?

**SHA-256** stands for **Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit**, and it's part of the **SHA-2 family**, developed by the **NSA** and published by **NIST** in 2001.

It produces a **256-bit (32-byte)** hash value and is currently considered **cryptographically secure**.

### 📦 Key Features

- 🔒 **Collision-resistant** (no practical collisions found so far)
- 💪 **Preimage resistance** (can’t reverse the hash to find input)
- 🧱 **Deterministic** (same input always gives same output)
- 🔁 **Fast** and optimized in hardware (used in blockchain, JWTs, etc.)

---

### 🛠️ SHA-256 in Python

```python
import hashlib

data = b"hello world"
hash_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()

print(f"SHA-256 Hash: {hash_sha256}")
```

Output:
```
SHA-256 Hash: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
```

### ✅ Where is SHA-256 Used?

- 🔐 **Digital certificates (SSL/TLS)**
- 💱 **Blockchain (Bitcoin uses it heavily)**
- 📄 **File integrity checks**
- 🪪 **JWT signing**
- 🧾 **APIs and HMACs**

---

### ⚠️ SHA-256 for Password Hashing?

**Nope.** It’s *too fast*, which makes brute-force attacks easier. Use:

- ✅ `bcrypt`
- ✅ `scrypt`
- ✅ `argon2`

Instead, you *can* use SHA-256 inside those algorithms or in HMAC constructions (e.g., `HMAC-SHA256`).
