  * Python programming with MySQL, SQLite and Cassandra

**The followings are optional**

  * HTTP Protocol and Microservice architecture
  * Web application development using SQL (HTML, Javascript, Python or Java framework for http server)
  * Database internal data structure algorithms.
  * Distributed file system and data storage using Hadoop.

We will provide you the optional information above and talked about them but it may not require a lot of homework with them.
