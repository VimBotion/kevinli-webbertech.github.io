# Homework 9 Network - VPN Setup

## A Lab Report (100 pts)

* Please set up VPN using our lab_vpn_setup.html instruction under `network forensic` category. This is a lab report. Because the VPN setup is one of the most important labs in our network study and it deals with certs, so if we master VPN setup and self-signed SSL, it would give us a lot of edge in real life.

* Please write a report with your own screenshots on each of the steps, especially how to test it and prove it is working.

* For testing, you can devise a test and prove it is working. And this is the major task of this homework.
