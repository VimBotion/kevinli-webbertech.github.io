## Requirements

* Your word report should include all the screenshots, and should indicate each task for each scanner. Fail to do so will lose these points. (15)
* You should do the homework independently. If I spot you copy from other people's screenshots, then both of you will evenly 
* split the final score, indicating you are getting less than 50 out of 100 pts, which is a mission failure.
