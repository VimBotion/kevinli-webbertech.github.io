# Syslog

Syslog is a standard logging system used in many Linux distributions.
Logs are stored in `/var/log/`, and common logs include /var/log/syslog (system logs), /var/log/auth.log (authentication logs), and /var/log/messages (system messages).

## Key Features:

* System and application logs: Analyze logs for any signs of unauthorized access or system errors.
* Centralized logging: Syslog can forward logs to remote servers for centralized logging.

## Use Cases:

* Reviewing system events and network access.
* Detecting unauthorized logins, system reboots, or application failures.
