**Use Cases**:
- Analyzing logs for unauthorized login attempts, privilege escalation, or suspicious activity.

#### **Syslog**

- **Syslog** is a standard logging system used in many Linux distributions.
  - Logs are stored in `/var/log/`, and common logs include **/var/log/syslog** (system logs), **/var/log/auth.log** (authentication logs), and **/var/log/messages** (system messages).
  
**Key Features**:
- **System and application logs**: Analyze logs for any signs of unauthorized access or system errors.
- **Centralized logging**: Syslog can forward logs to remote servers for centralized logging.

**Use Cases**:
- Reviewing system events and network access.
- Detecting unauthorized logins, system reboots, or application failures.

### **5. Wireshark**

- **Wireshark** is a powerful open-source network protocol analyzer that allows investigators to capture and analyze network traffic. It can be used to investigate network activity during an attack or data exfiltration.

**Key Features**:
- **Packet capture**: Capture network traffic from network interfaces.
- **Traffic analysis**: Analyze packets, identify suspicious network traffic, and track communication to/from an attacker.
- **Protocol analysis**: Decode and analyze hundreds of different network protocols, including HTTP, DNS, SSH, and more.

**Use Cases**:
- Investigating network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or attack.
- Identifying unauthorized communication between compromised hosts.

### **6. X1 Search**

- **X1 Search** is a commercial forensic tool used for indexing and searching across large datasets, including files, emails, and documents in a Linux system.

**Key Features**:
- **Search functionality**: Fast indexing and searching of files and system data.
- **File metadata analysis**: Search based on file names, extensions, or metadata.
- **Email forensics**: Search and analyze email messages for relevant content.

**Use Cases**:
- Searching for evidence in large volumes of documents and email communications.
- Quickly locating files and emails based on content or metadata.
