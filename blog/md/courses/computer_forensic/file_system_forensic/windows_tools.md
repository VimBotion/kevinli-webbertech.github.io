### **Conclusion**

Windows file system forensics is an essential aspect of digital investigations. By leveraging the unique features of the Windows file system (NTFS, FAT), analyzing deleted files, and recovering valuable evidence from system logs, volume shadow copies, and metadata, forensic investigators can uncover critical information in legal, criminal, and corporate investigations.

The process involves collecting and preserving data, performing detailed analysis on file system structures (MFT, FAT, etc.), and recovering deleted or hidden files. Tools such as **FTK Imager**, **EnCase**, and **Autopsy** are invaluable for investigating Windows file systems and recovering forensic evidence.
