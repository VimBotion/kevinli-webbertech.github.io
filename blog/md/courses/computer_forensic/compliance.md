In particular, it discusses establishing an audit trail, supporting a forensics investigation after an incident. An audit trail is a chronological record that documents security-relevant events. Various log messages generated by software and hardware are an example of an audit trail.

It mandates a process to provide a timely computer forensics investigation after a compromise occurs. The Federal Information Security Management Act, or FSMA of 2002, requires federal organizations to generate and retain an immutable audit trail that enables a computer forensics investigation after a security incident.
