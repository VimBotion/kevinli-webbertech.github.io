### **Certifications**

Obtaining a certification is an excellent way to increase your credibility as a digital forensics investigator. There are mainly two different types of certifications out there. One is those provided by tool vendors, the other is provided by professional associations. We'll look into these certifications in more detail one by one. Let's look at the OpenText EnCase Certified Examiner, or EnCE, program first. It requires 64 hours of authorized computer forensics training or 12 months of computer forensics work experience. Next is the certification provided by Exterro. The requirements for this certification include access to Forensics Toolkit, or FTK. This certification provided by Exterro is called Access Data Certified Examiner, or ACE. EC-Council also provides a certification. This one is vendor-neutral and open to the public. The name of the certification is Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator, or CHFI. Finally, there's a certification provided by an organization called the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists, or IACIS. In this case, the certification is more for law enforcement officers or government employees. The name of the certification is Certified Forensic Computer Examiner, or CFCE. If you decide to become a career computer forensics investigator, consider obtaining one of these computer forensics certifications.
