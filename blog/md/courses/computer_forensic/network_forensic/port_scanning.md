### **Port Scanning: An Overview**

Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services available on a computer or network. It is commonly used for network security assessments, as well as by attackers to discover vulnerabilities in a system. When a computer or network device communicates over the Internet or a local network, it does so using **ports** that are associated with different services (such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.).

### **What Are Ports?**
A **port** is a logical endpoint for network communication, where each service or application on a computer or server listens for incoming traffic on a specific port number.

- **Port numbers range from 0 to 65535**, and are divided into several categories:
  - **Well-known Ports (0–1023)**: Reserved for common services like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), etc.
  - **Registered Ports (1024–49151)**: Used by less common services and applications.
  - **Dynamic or Private Ports (49152–65535)**: Used by client applications for ephemeral communication.

### **Why is Port Scanning Used?**
1. **Network Security**:
   - **Administrators** use port scanning to find open ports and ensure they are secure or not unnecessarily exposed to the internet. They may scan to check if any unauthorized services are running.
   - **Penetration testers** use port scanning to identify potential attack vectors and discover vulnerabilities.

2. **Malicious Attacks**:
   - **Hackers** use port scanning to identify open ports on a target system and exploit vulnerabilities in services running on those ports. Port scanning is often the first step in gaining unauthorized access to a system.

### **Types of Port Scanning Techniques**

Port scanning can be done in different ways, depending on the specific needs and techniques used by an attacker or an administrator. Here are some common methods:

1. **TCP Connect Scan**:
   - This is the simplest form of scanning, where a full TCP connection is made to the target port (i.e., it follows the 3-way handshake).
   - If the port is open, the connection is completed, and the scanner receives a response (SYN-ACK). If closed, the scanner receives a RST (reset).
   - **Pros**: Easy to detect but reliable.
   - **Cons**: The scan can be easily detected because the full connection is made, and logs will show incoming connections.

2. **SYN Scan (Half-Open Scan)**:
   - In this technique, the scanner sends a SYN packet (the first step in the TCP handshake) to a target port.
   - If the port is open, the target will respond with a SYN-ACK, but the scanner does not complete the handshake, sending a RST instead to abort the connection.
   - This technique is called "half-open" because the connection is never fully established.
   - **Pros**: Faster and stealthier compared to a full TCP connection scan.
   - **Cons**: It is still detectable by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls because the SYN packets will be logged.

3. **FIN Scan**:
   - In this scan, the attacker sends a FIN packet (which is typically used to terminate a connection) to the target port.
   - If the port is closed, the target system will respond with a RST (reset). If the port is open, no response is sent.
   - **Pros**: Can bypass some firewalls and packet filters because it looks like a "closed" connection request.
   - **Cons**: Not effective on all operating systems, as some will respond to the FIN packet regardless of the port state.

4. **Xmas Scan**:
   - This scan sends a packet with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set, which is called a "Christmas tree" scan because of the way the flags are lit up.
   - Similar to the FIN scan, if the port is closed, a RST packet is sent; if the port is open, there is no response.
   - **Pros**: It can bypass firewalls and packet filters in some cases.
   - **Cons**: Like the FIN scan, it is not reliable on all operating systems.

5. **UDP Scan**:
   - UDP is connectionless, so there is no handshake like with TCP.
   - A scanner sends UDP packets to the target ports and listens for responses. If a port is closed, it will respond with an ICMP "port unreachable" message. If the port is open, there is no response or a specific service reply (e.g., DNS query response).
   - **Pros**: Can be used to scan UDP services (DNS, SNMP, etc.), which are often overlooked by security administrators.
   - **Cons**: Can be difficult to interpret results, and certain firewalls might block or limit UDP traffic.

6. **ACK Scan**:
   - This technique sends an ACK packet to the target port, which is part of the ongoing connection (used for acknowledging received data).
   - This type of scan is typically used for **mapping firewall rules** (identifying whether a port is filtered).
   - **Pros**: It helps to identify open or closed ports behind a firewall.
   - **Cons**: It's not designed to find open services but can help in firewall testing.

7. **Stealth Scanning**:
   - The goal of stealth scanning is to avoid detection by the target system's intrusion detection system (IDS).
   - Techniques like SYN scan or FIN scan are often used to remain undetected.
   - **Pros**: Harder to detect by IDS systems.
   - **Cons**: It can still leave traces depending on the configuration of the network.

### **Port Scanning Tools**

Several tools are used for port scanning, with the most popular being:

1. **Nmap (Network Mapper)**:
   - Nmap is the most widely used tool for network discovery and security auditing.
   - It can perform different types of scans (SYN, TCP connect, UDP, etc.), OS fingerprinting, version detection, and vulnerability scanning.
   - Example: 
     ```
     nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
     ```

2. **Netcat**:
   - Netcat is a simple networking tool that can be used for scanning ports, sending data over the network, and other networking tasks.
   - Example:
     ```
     nc -zv 192.168.1.1 80-443
     ```

3. **Zenmap**:
   - Zenmap is the graphical interface for Nmap, making it easier to use for non-experts.
   - It provides visual representation of the results and helps in scanning more complex networks.

4. **Masscan**:
   - Masscan is a very fast port scanner capable of scanning the entire IPv4 address space in under 6 minutes, at a rate of 10 million packets per second.
   - Example:
     ```
     masscan -p80 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

5. **Hping**:
   - Hping is a network tool that can be used for port scanning, firewall testing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
   - It is used for sending custom packets and analyzing the response.
   - Example:
     ```
     hping3 -S 192.168.1.1 -p 80
     ```

### **Port Scanning and Ethics**

Port scanning is often used for legitimate purposes such as network administration and security auditing. However, unauthorized port scanning can be considered an illegal activity and may be against the law, depending on the region and the network being scanned.

- **Penetration Testing**: Port scanning is an integral part of penetration testing, where an ethical hacker scans systems with permission to identify vulnerabilities and improve security.
- **Unauthorized Scanning**: Scanning systems or networks without permission is generally illegal. It can lead to criminal charges, including unauthorized access and data theft.

### **Conclusion**

Port scanning is a fundamental technique for discovering open ports and services running on a computer or network. It is widely used in network administration, security testing, and by attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. Understanding the different port scanning techniques and their ethical implications is crucial for anyone involved in network security or penetration testing.

Let's dive deeper into how you can perform specific types of port scans using popular tools like **Nmap** and **Masscan**. We will go through the detailed steps for **Nmap** first, as it's the most commonly used tool for port scanning, and then discuss how to use **Masscan** for very fast scans.

### **1. Nmap (Network Mapper) Overview**

Nmap is an open-source tool used for network exploration and security auditing. It supports several types of port scans and can also detect operating systems, services, and their versions.

#### **Basic Nmap Syntax**:
```
nmap [options] [target]
```

Where:
- **[options]**: The type of scan or options you want to use.
- **[target]**: The IP address or range of IP addresses to scan.

#### **Common Nmap Port Scanning Options**:

1. **TCP Connect Scan** (`-sT`):
   - This is the default option for Nmap. It opens a full TCP connection to the target port and completes the handshake.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
     ```

2. **SYN Scan** (`-sS`):
   - This is a "stealth scan" that only sends SYN packets to the target port, never completing the TCP handshake. It's faster and less detectable than a full TCP connect scan.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
     ```

3. **UDP Scan** (`-sU`):
   - This scan is used to check for open UDP ports. UDP is connectionless, so there is no handshake. Nmap sends a UDP packet to the target and waits for a response.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
     ```

4. **Service Version Detection** (`-sV`):
   - This option tells Nmap to attempt to determine the version of the services running on the open ports.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
     ```

5. **OS Detection** (`-O`):
   - This option enables OS fingerprinting to determine the operating system of the target system.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -O 192.168.1.1
     ```

6. **Aggressive Scan** (`-A`):
   - The aggressive scan performs multiple actions at once: version detection, OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -A 192.168.1.1
     ```

7. **Scan Multiple Ports or Port Ranges**:
   - To scan specific ports or ranges of ports, you can specify the ports after the target.
   - **Command** (for specific ports):
     ```
     nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
     ```
   - **Command** (for a range of ports):
     ```
     nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
     ```

8. **Stealth Scan Using FIN Scan** (`-sF`):
   - The FIN scan sends FIN packets to the target. If the port is closed, the target sends a RST, but if it is open, there is no response.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap -sF 192.168.1.1
     ```

9. **Scan a Subnet**:
   - To scan an entire subnet, use CIDR notation to define the range.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     nmap 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

### **Performing a Port Scan with Nmap Example**

Let's say you want to scan the first 1000 ports on the IP address `192.168.1.1`:

1. **Simple TCP Scan**:
   ```
   nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
   ```

2. **SYN Scan for Stealth**:
   ```
   nmap -sS -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
   ```

3. **Service Version Detection**:
   ```
   nmap -sS -sV -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
   ```

4. **Aggressive Scan**:
   ```
   nmap -A 192.168.1.1
   ```

The results will show you which ports are open and what services and versions are running on those ports.

### **2. Masscan (Fast Port Scanning)**

Masscan is a fast port scanner that can scan the entire IPv4 address space in just a few minutes. It is designed for high-speed scanning and is often used for large-scale network scans. Masscan can be significantly faster than Nmap, but it may not have as many features for detailed inspection.

#### **Basic Masscan Syntax**:
```
masscan [options] [target]
```

Where:
- **[options]**: The flags and parameters to specify the scan type and options.
- **[target]**: The IP address or range of IP addresses to scan.

#### **Common Masscan Options**:

1. **Basic Port Scan**:
   - To scan a specific range of ports on a target:
   - **Command**:
     ```
     masscan 192.168.1.1 -p80,443,8080
     ```

2. **Scan a Port Range**:
   - To scan a range of ports:
   - **Command**:
     ```
     masscan 192.168.1.1 -p1-1000
     ```

3. **Scan a Subnet**:
   - To scan a subnet, use CIDR notation:
   - **Command**:
     ```
     masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p80,443
     ```

4. **Scan All Ports**:
   - To scan all 65535 ports:
   - **Command**:
     ```
     masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p0-65535
     ```

5. **Speed Control**:
   - Masscan allows you to control the scan speed with the `--rate` option (packets per second).
   - **Command** (scan at 1000 packets per second):
     ```
     masscan 192.168.1.1 -p80,443 --rate 1000
     ```

#### **Example: Scanning a Network with Masscan**

To scan a range of ports (1-1000) on a network range `192.168.1.0/24`:

```
masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p1-1000 --rate 1000
```

This command will scan the first 1000 ports on all hosts in the `192.168.1.0/24` range at a speed of 1000 packets per second.

### **Comparison Between Nmap and Masscan**:

- **Nmap**:
  - Comprehensive and feature-rich.
  - Slower compared to Masscan but provides detailed information about services, OS, and vulnerabilities.
  - Supports a wide range of scan types (e.g., SYN scan, FIN scan, service detection, OS fingerprinting).
  
- **Masscan**:
  - Extremely fast, capable of scanning entire address spaces.
  - Lacks the detailed features that Nmap offers, such as service version detection or OS fingerprinting.
  - Ideal for large-scale network scanning where speed is critical and less detailed information is needed.

### **Security Considerations for Port Scanning**

- **Legal Issues**: Unauthorized port scanning is often considered illegal, especially if done without the network owner’s consent. Always make sure you have permission to scan a network.
- **Detection**: Both Nmap and Masscan can be detected by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). The more stealthy scans (like SYN scan or FIN scan) can bypass some defenses, but network monitoring systems can still detect scanning activity.
- **Firewall and IDS/IPS**: Port scans may trigger alerts if a system is configured to detect suspicious activities. This can cause the scanning IP to be blacklisted or blocked.

### **Conclusion**

Port scanning is an essential technique for network discovery, security assessment, and troubleshooting. Tools like **Nmap** offer detailed scans and vulnerability detection, while **Masscan** provides lightning-fast scanning for large networks. Understanding when and how to use these tools appropriately is important for both network administrators and security professionals.

Great! Let's walk through more detailed examples and specific scenarios for both **Nmap** and **Masscan**, covering how to use them effectively for different network scanning tasks. I'll also address how to interpret results and tailor scans based on your needs.

### **Detailed Nmap Examples**

#### **1. Simple Port Scan**

You want to scan a single target IP (`192.168.1.1`) for the first 1000 TCP ports (the default scan range). This is a basic scan to see which ports are open.

**Command**:
```
nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-p 1-1000`: Specifies the port range from 1 to 1000 to be scanned.
- `192.168.1.1`: The target IP address.

**Expected Output** (simplified):
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 12:00 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.00053s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.32 seconds
```

This output shows that ports **22 (SSH)**, **80 (HTTP)**, and **443 (HTTPS)** are open on the target IP.

#### **2. SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)**

A SYN scan is often referred to as a "half-open" scan. It only sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the target, and if the target port is open, it will respond with a SYN-ACK packet. Since the handshake isn't completed, the scan is stealthier.

**Command**:
```
nmap -sS -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-sS`: Specifies a SYN scan (stealth scan).
- `-p 22,80,443`: Specifies specific ports to scan.
- `192.168.1.1`: The target IP address.

**Expected Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 12:05 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0003s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  open   https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.23 seconds
```

This shows open ports **22**, **80**, and **443** on the target, just like the TCP connect scan, but the scan was faster and stealthier.

#### **3. Version Detection**

Nmap can also detect the version of services running on the open ports. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities or services that need to be updated.

**Command**:
```
nmap -sV -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-sV`: Version detection. This tells Nmap to try to determine the version of services running on the open ports.

**Expected Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 12:10 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0003s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.18
443/tcp  open   https   Apache httpd 2.4.18

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.23 seconds
```

This scan gives detailed information about the services running:
- **SSH**: OpenSSH 7.2p2 (Ubuntu)
- **HTTP**: Apache 2.4.18
- **HTTPS**: Apache 2.4.18

Knowing the versions helps security professionals identify whether the services have known vulnerabilities.

#### **4. OS Detection**

Nmap can attempt to detect the operating system running on the target by analyzing the response patterns from the target.

**Command**:
```
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-O`: OS detection.

**Expected Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 12:15 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0004s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  open   https

OS fingerprint not found.
```

If Nmap can't accurately detect the OS, it will report "OS fingerprint not found". This might be due to firewalls or evasive techniques on the target. But if it can determine the OS, it will output the OS type (e.g., Linux, Windows, etc.).

#### **5. Aggressive Scan**

The aggressive scan performs a series of operations, including port scanning, version detection, OS detection, and script scanning (using Nmap Scripting Engine, NSE). This scan can take longer but is thorough.

**Command**:
```
nmap -A 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-A`: Aggressive scan (includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute).

**Expected Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 12:20 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0003s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.18
443/tcp  open   https   Apache httpd 2.4.18
8080/tcp open   http    Apache Tomcat 8.5.69
MAC Address: 00:14:22:58:4A:F2 (Cisco)

Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
OS detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.32 seconds
```

This scan reveals:
- The **Apache Tomcat** service on port 8080.
- The MAC address of the device (`00:14:22:58:4A:F2`).
- The **OS is identified as Linux**.

---

### **Masscan: Fast Port Scanning**

**Masscan** is useful for scanning large networks quickly. It's ideal for scanning large IP ranges (e.g., entire subnets or even the entire IPv4 address space) when you need speed rather than detailed information.

#### **1. Basic Masscan Scan**

Masscan is often used when you need to quickly identify open ports across many systems.

**Command**:
```
masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p80,443 --rate 1000
```

**Explanation**:
- `192.168.1.0/24`: The target subnet.
- `-p80,443`: The ports to scan (HTTP and HTTPS).
- `--rate 1000`: The rate at which packets are sent (1000 packets per second).

**Expected Output**:
```
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 192.168.1.1
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 192.168.1.1
```

This output shows that ports **80** and **443** are open on the target system. Masscan performs this scan quickly due to its high packet rate.

#### **2. Scan Multiple Ports with Masscan**

You can scan multiple ports, similar to Nmap.

**Command**:
```
masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p1-1000 --rate 1000
```

**Explanation**:
- `-p1-1000`: Scan ports 1 through 1000.
- `--rate 1000`: Send 1000 packets per second.

Masscan will quickly report the open ports across all hosts in the subnet.

#### **3. Scanning All Ports**

Masscan can scan all 65535 ports on a range of IPs at high speed.

**Command**:
```
masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p0-65535 --rate 5000
```

**Explanation**:
- `-p0-65535`: Scan all ports.
- `--rate 5000`: Set the packet rate to 5000 packets per second.

This scan will be faster than Nmap, but it doesn't provide as much detailed service information as Nmap does.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **Nmap** is great for detailed, slow-to-medium speed scans and provides comprehensive results (including service versions, OS fingerprinting, and vulnerabilities). It is ideal for security assessments and penetration testing.
- **Masscan** is much faster, making it ideal for scanning large networks or IP ranges quickly. However, it lacks the depth of service version detection and other features that Nmap offers.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Use **Nmap** for detailed and slower scans when you need to know about the services running on specific ports.
- Use **Masscan** for fast scans over large networks or IP ranges.

### Advanced Scanning Techniques with Nmap

Nmap provides a wide range of advanced scanning techniques that can be used for different purposes, such as evading detection, analyzing services, or discovering vulnerabilities. Below, I'll go through several advanced scanning techniques, explain when and how to use them, and give you examples.

### **1. OS Fingerprinting with Nmap (`-O`)**

**OS fingerprinting** is a technique that allows you to identify the operating system of a target machine based on how it responds to certain types of probes. Nmap sends various packets and then analyzes the responses to guess the OS.

#### **Command**:
```
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-O`: This flag enables OS detection.
- `192.168.1.1`: Target IP address.

#### **Example Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 14:00 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0005s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  open   https

OS fingerprint not found.
```

If the OS is detected, it will show something like:
```
OS details: Linux 3.2 - 4.9
```

If Nmap cannot determine the OS, the result will indicate "OS fingerprint not found."

### **2. Nmap Version Detection (`-sV`)**

Version detection allows Nmap to identify the version of the services running on open ports. This can help to determine if a service is running a vulnerable version.

#### **Command**:
```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-sV`: Enables version detection.
- `192.168.1.1`: Target IP address.

#### **Example Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 14:05 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0004s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.18
443/tcp  open   https   Apache httpd 2.4.18

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.32 seconds
```

### **3. Nmap Script Scanning with NSE (`-sC` or `--script`)**

Nmap has a scripting engine called **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)**, which allows you to automate the scanning process to detect vulnerabilities and other useful information. You can either run **default scripts** or specify **custom scripts**.

#### **Command** (using default scripts):
```
nmap -sC 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-sC`: Runs the default set of scripts (which include service version detection, vulnerabilities, etc.).

#### **Command** (using a specific script):
```
nmap --script=http-vuln-cve2014-3704 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `--script=http-vuln-cve2014-3704`: Runs a specific script that checks for the **Drupal vulnerability CVE-2014-3704** (a known vulnerability in the Apache web server).
- `192.168.1.1`: Target IP address.

### **4. Scan for IPv6 Hosts (`-6`)**

Nmap supports IPv6, and you can use the `-6` flag to scan IPv6 addresses and networks.

#### **Command**:
```
nmap -6 2001:0db8::/32
```

**Explanation**:
- `-6`: This flag tells Nmap to scan using IPv6.
- `2001:0db8::/32`: This is the target IPv6 network range.

#### **5. Timing and Stealth (`-T` and `--max-retries`)**

Sometimes you want to slow down or speed up your scan depending on your needs. Nmap provides a **timing template** (`-T` option), which controls the scan's speed and stealthiness. The `--max-retries` option controls how many times Nmap will retry a port before marking it as closed.

#### **Command (Stealthy Scan)**:
```
nmap -T0 --max-retries 2 -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-T0`: Set the timing to the slowest level (stealthy).
- `--max-retries 2`: Limit the number of retries to 2.
- `-p 80,443`: Scan ports 80 and 443.

This type of scan would be less noticeable by intrusion detection systems but could take longer.

#### **Command (Faster Scan)**:
```
nmap -T4 --max-retries 1 -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-T4`: Set the timing to a faster level (quick but detectable).
- `--max-retries 1`: Only retry a port scan once.
- `-p 1-1000`: Scan the first 1000 ports.

This scan would be faster but more likely to be detected.

### **6. Scanning for Firewalls (`-sA` or ACK Scan)**

An **ACK scan** is useful for discovering firewall rules. It sends ACK packets (used to acknowledge received data) to ports and analyzes how the target responds. A response or lack of response can help determine which ports are filtered or open.

#### **Command**:
```
nmap -sA 192.168.1.1
```

**Explanation**:
- `-sA`: ACK scan.
- `192.168.1.1`: Target IP address.

**Expected Output**:
```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 14:20 UTC
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.0006s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp   open     ssh
80/tcp   filtered http
443/tcp  filtered https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.32 seconds
```

In this output:
- Ports **80** and **443** are **filtered**, which means they are being blocked by a firewall or some form of filtering device.

### **7. Scan Multiple Targets or Entire Subnet**

Nmap allows you to scan multiple targets at once using a comma-separated list or CIDR notation.

#### **Command** (Multiple IPs):
```
nmap 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2 -p 22,80,443
```

#### **Command** (Scan an entire subnet):
```
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22,80,443
```

#### **Command** (Scan an entire range of IPs):
```
nmap 192.168.1.1-100 -p 22,80,443
```

### **8. Banner Grabbing**

Sometimes you just want to grab the **banner** of a service running on a port (to see what version it is, for instance). You can do this using Nmap's **service detection**.

#### **Command**:
```
nmap --script=banner 192.168.1.1 -p 80,443
```

**Explanation**:
- `--script=banner`: Uses the Nmap Scripting Engine to grab banners from the specified ports.

### **Conclusion**

These advanced scanning techniques help to perform deep network reconnaissance, discover vulnerabilities, and profile systems and services. Some of the advanced options (like version detection, OS detection, and NSE scripts) provide rich insights that are invaluable for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

Let's explore **additional advanced features** of **Nmap** that can enhance your scanning capabilities for network discovery, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing. These features allow you to go beyond basic scanning to gather deeper insights about a target system or network.

### **Advanced Nmap Features**

#### **1. Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**
The **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** is a powerful feature that allows you to extend Nmap's functionality with custom scripts. NSE can be used for a variety of tasks, from basic service detection to more advanced vulnerability scanning, exploiting known vulnerabilities, or even brute-force attacks.

- **Running NSE Scripts**: Nmap includes a huge library of predefined scripts for common vulnerabilities and protocols.
  
  **Command** (Running default scripts):
  ```
  nmap -sC 192.168.1.1
  ```
  - `-sC`: Runs the default set of scripts, which covers service version detection, vulnerability scanning, and OS detection.

  **Command** (Running a specific NSE script):
  ```
  nmap --script=ssl-heartbleed 192.168.1.1 -p 443
  ```
  - `--script=ssl-heartbleed`: This specific script checks for the Heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) on HTTPS ports.

- **Common NSE Scripts**:
  - `http-vuln-cve2014-3704`: Detects the vulnerability in Drupal (CVE-2014-3704).
  - `ftp-anon`: Checks for anonymous FTP access.
  - `smb-vuln-ms17-010`: Detects vulnerabilities related to SMB (e.g., EternalBlue).
  - `ssh-brute`: Performs brute-force SSH login attempts.

  **Example Output**:
  ```
  Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-20 15:30 UTC
  Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
  Host is up (0.0004s latency).
  Not shown: 999 closed ports
  PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
  443/tcp  open   https  Apache httpd 2.4.18
  | ssl-heartbleed: 
  |   VULNERABLE:
  |   Heartbleed vulnerability
  |     State: VULNERABLE
  |     Risk factor: High
  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.33 seconds
  ```

#### **2. Nmap Timing and Performance Control**
Nmap provides several ways to control the timing and performance of your scans. Adjusting timing options can help balance the speed and stealthiness of the scan.

- **Timing Templates**: Nmap offers predefined timing templates (`-T0` to `-T5`) for controlling the scan's aggressiveness.

  - `-T0`: Slowest scan, stealthy, useful for avoiding detection.
  - `-T5`: Fastest scan, high likelihood of being detected, suitable for less critical scans.

  **Command** (Slow, stealthy scan):
  ```
  nmap -T0 192.168.1.1
  ```

  **Command** (Fast, aggressive scan):
  ```
  nmap -T5 192.168.1.1
  ```

- **Max Retries**: You can specify the maximum number of retries to send to a port before Nmap considers it closed.

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap --max-retries 1 -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
  ```

- **Parallelism**: Nmap allows you to control how many hosts are scanned simultaneously with the `--min-parallelism` and `--max-parallelism` options.

  **Command** (Control scan parallelism):
  ```
  nmap --min-parallelism 10 --max-parallelism 50 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

#### **3. Nmap Firewall Evasion Techniques**
If you need to bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or intrusion prevention systems (IPS), Nmap offers several techniques to obscure or disguise your scan.

- **Fragmented Packets**: You can fragment your packets into smaller chunks to avoid detection by network firewalls.

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap -f 192.168.1.1
  ```

  - `-f`: Fragment packets to avoid detection.

- **Source Port**: You can specify the source port of the scan to make it appear as though it’s coming from a legitimate service like HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap --source-port 80 192.168.1.1
  ```

  - `--source-port 80`: Makes the scan appear as though it's coming from the HTTP port.

- **Decoy Scan**: You can launch a decoy scan that hides your actual IP address by sending decoy packets from random IPs along with the real scan packets.

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap -D RND:10 192.168.1.1
  ```

  - `-D RND:10`: Use 10 random decoys to mask the source of the scan.

#### **4. NSE Brute-Force and Password Cracking**
Nmap can be used to perform brute-force attacks on various services (like SSH, FTP, HTTP authentication). The `ssh-brute` and `http-brute` scripts are common tools for testing weak passwords.

- **Command** (Brute-forcing SSH):
  ```
  nmap --script=ssh-brute -p 22 192.168.1.1
  ```

- **Command** (Brute-forcing HTTP):
  ```
  nmap --script=http-brute -p 80 192.168.1.1
  ```

#### **5. Traceroute and Network Mapping**
Nmap can be used for mapping the network topology using **traceroute**. This shows the path taken by packets from the source machine to the target.

- **Command**:
  ```
  nmap --traceroute 192.168.1.1
  ```

  This provides information on each hop and the network devices between the source and target.

#### **6. Nmap Script for Vulnerability Scanning**
Nmap can be used to scan for **known vulnerabilities** using the `vuln` category of NSE scripts. These scripts check for specific vulnerabilities on the target system and report them.

- **Command**:
  ```
  nmap --script=vuln 192.168.1.1
  ```

  This will run scripts designed to detect various vulnerabilities, such as **SMB vulnerabilities**, **Heartbleed**, **SQL injection**, and more.

#### **7. Nmap Service and Host Discovery**
Nmap can discover hosts on a network and identify active services, even when there’s minimal data available (such as in a large subnet).

- **Ping Scan**: Only discovers whether hosts are up without scanning any ports.

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

  - `-sn`: Ping scan (no port scanning).

- **Service Discovery**: Use Nmap to automatically detect services running on open ports.

  **Command**:
  ```
  nmap -sV --open 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

  - `-sV`: Detect services and their versions.
  - `--open`: Only show hosts with open ports.

#### **8. Scan for SSL/TLS Certificates and Vulnerabilities**
Nmap includes scripts to check for SSL/TLS vulnerabilities, outdated certificates, and weak cipher suites.

- **Command** (SSL/TLS version and cipher suite detection):
  ```
  nmap --script=ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 192.168.1.1
  ```

- **Command** (Check for SSL Heartbleed vulnerability):
  ```
  nmap --script=ssl-heartbleed -p 443 192.168.1.1
  ```

This script will check for Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) and other SSL-related vulnerabilities.

### **Conclusion**
