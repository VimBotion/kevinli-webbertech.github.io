## Unified batch and streaming APIs

Spark Structured Streaming provides the same structured APIs (DataFrames and Datasets) as Spark so that you donâ€™t need to develop on or maintain two different technology stacks for batch and streaming. In addition, unified APIs make it easy to migrate your existing batch Spark jobs to streaming jobs.
