# Big Data Analytics Syllabus

## Homework and Projects

* Every one or two weeks depends on the content.
* Midterm we will be doing some Machine learning project
* Final project - Project based

## Outcome and Expectations

After this class, students will have a general idea of the core toolchains of big data analysis in the market and will be able to utilize the most popular programming language and libraries to do the data access, collection, curation and analysis. And we also survey the best and up-to-date commercial platforms of big data analysis and get our hands on their usage.

## 15 Weeks Schedule

|Unit  | Content| Goal  |
|------|--------|-------|
|Week 1|Introduction to Big Data Analytics|Get familiarized with Docker, Hadoop container, and learn how Hadoop’s components and distributed file system.  We will talk about Hadoop and Spark. And the installation of Hadoop, both the native way and the dockerized container.|

|Week 2|Hadoop Distributed File Systems and MapReduce|

In-class Hadoop Lab and compile Java code to run the distributed jobs and see how to receive the file results. We will introduce Hadoop’s DFS commands and how to compile and run the examples to run the distributed jobs. And also we will introduce NCDC Dataset.|

|Week 3|  Pandas Series & DataFrame|Hands on programming with some public huge data set.|

|Week 4| Pandas Selection|Hands on programming with some public huge data set.|

|Week 5| Pandas Data Frame Transformation|Hands on programming with some public huge data set.|

|Week 6| Pandas Data Frame Aggregation|Hands on programming with some public huge data set.|

|Week 7| Data Visualization|Mathplotlib and Seaborn.|

|Week 8| Spark Introduction|--|

|Week 9| Spark DataFrame Data Types|

|Week 10| Spark DataFrame Aggregation|

|Week 11| Spark Data Sources and SQL|

|Week 12| Spark Deployment and Streaming|

|Week 13 Spark ML|

|Week 14| AIGC|
AIGC is generated based on the intentional information extracted from human-provided instructions by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. AIGC quickly and automatically generates large amounts of high-quality content.|
