# Topic: Time Series Analysis with pmdarima

## Problem Description

Instructions. Please write code in Python to build an auto arima model to
predict the power usage.

* Requirement 1. Download data from here [GEFCom2014](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10caPNePhGMOZW1W5-bFbqplsqVpS7BMz/view?usp=sharing). Use data in 2012 and 2013 as training set, and data in 2014 as testing set.

* Requirement 2. Use load as the target variable to predict and temp as the external variable.

* Requirement 3. Build a pipeline with boxcox transformation and auto arima model.

* Requirement 4. Limit training and tuning to 10 minutes.

## Submission Guideline

1. Work individually.

2. Please submit a .ipynb file.

3. Submit your solution on Canvas on time. A late penalty of 10 points for each late day applies. Any late for more than three days receives zero automatically.
