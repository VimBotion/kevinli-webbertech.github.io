## Visualize 3D barchart from a json file (100 pts)

Please read the following content on my website,

https://kevinli-webbertech.github.io/blog/html/courses/data_visualization/echarts/echarts_4.html

And look for `3D Bar with Dataset`,

Try to reproduct the data visualization using my own downloaded json file,
you can find it here,

`https://kevinli-webbertech.github.io/blog/md/courses/data_visualization/echarts/code/life-expectancy-table.json`

This means in your js file, you would need to call the above full url for the json data file.

To help you finish this homework and structure your files, you would need to following the files/folder structure in the following link, 

https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/l5vskq

And eventually the effect on your browser should look like the following,

You need to provide screenshots that this visualization is working on `your own` computer browser.
Without working, you will be scored at your best effort.

If you still do not know and need extra help, you could inspect my html code in the folloiwng url,
