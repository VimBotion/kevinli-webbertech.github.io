# Midterm Homework

Use chatGPT to research what is `MACD` indicator of the stock market. Write me an assay about,

1/ What it is MACD, how it works and include the math formulas. (30 pts)

2/ Implement a MACD function in Python and use matplotlib to plot to show you can actually implement it. (30 pts)

3/ Use MACD to write a backtesting to run stock symbol "AAPL" [Apple Inc] and ETF symbol "VOO", and another stock symbol "zm" for [Zoom Inc]. (30 pts, 10 pts each). Emulating and backtesting these symbols from Jan 1st 2020 to March 14th 2025.

4/ You will need to provide a word or pdf document with all your writing and your images in it.
If you did not write any words but just throw some images you would get 80 pts out of 100 maximum.

>Hint: 1/ Please use Deepseek or ChatGPT for anything you do not know such as `MACD`, `backtesting` and more.  

2/ Ask AI tools to write you code as well.

3/ You can ask chatGPT or Deepseek to write raw Python code or you can let them use opensource external python libraries to reduce the lines of code. What are important is the visualization part.
