# Spark Docker

## Install PySpark

For Python users, PySpark can be installed directly from PyPI.

`pip3 install pyspark`

## Using Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker to run Spark. Official Spark images are available on Dockerhub. This method is useful for avoiding dependency issues.

`docker pull apache/spark:3.5.1`
